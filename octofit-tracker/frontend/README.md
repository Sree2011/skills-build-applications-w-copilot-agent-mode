# OctoFit Frontend (minimal scaffold)

This directory contains a minimal React scaffold for the OctoFit Tracker frontend. It is intentionally small so `npm install --prefix .` can be used to install dependencies into this directory.

How to install dependencies and run locally (from workspace root):

```bash
# install dependencies into the frontend folder
npm install --prefix octofit-tracker/frontend

# start dev server
npm --prefix octofit-tracker/frontend start
```

Bootstrap CSS is imported in `src/index.js`.
